Abstract

Conventional short-term reversal strategies exhibit dynamic exposures to the Fama and French
(1993) factors. We develop a novel reversal strategy based on residual stock returns that does not
exhibit these exposures and consequently earns risk-adjusted returns that are twice as large as those
of a conventional reversal strategy. Residual reversal strategies generate statistically and evonomic-
ally significant profits net of trading costs, even when we restrict our sample to large-cap stocks over
the post-1990 period. Our results are inconsistent with the notion that reversal effects are the result of|
trading frietions or non-synchronows trading of stocks and pose a serious challenge to rational asset
pricing models.

1. Introduction

‘A conventional short-term reversal strategy as documented by Lehmann (1990) and
Jegadeesh (1990), i, a strategy that buys (sells) stocks with low (high) total returns
over the past month, exhibits dynamic exposures to the Fama and French (1993) factors.
AS these implicit factor bets are inversely related to factor return realizations over the
formation month, the reversal strategy is negatively exposed to the short-term momentum

effect in factor returns of Moskowitz and Grinblatt (1999) and Chen and De Bondt (2004),
As a result, the dynamic factor exposures of a reversal strategy are likely to negatively
affect its profitability, while, at the same time, contributing significantly to the risks
involved.

We introduce a short-term reversal strategy based on residual stock returns that does
not exhibit such dynamic factor exposures and find that this strategy earns returns that are
higher and substantially less volatile than those of a conventional short-term reversal
strategy. More specifically, stock residual returns are computed by adjusting total returns
for the stocks’ exposures to the Fama-French factors and scaling the residual returns by
their volatility. We document that this reversal strategy earns risk-adjusted returns that are
twice as large as those of a conventional reversal strategy. Our results also show that the
strategy’s profitability has been relatively stable over our sample period from January 1929
to December 2010, including the more recent decades, and that profitability remains
economically and statistically significant after taking trading costs into account. In
addition, we show that residual stock returns have predictive power for future returns
above and beyond that of total stock returns.

Several authors have argued that the profits of conventional short-term reversal
strategies largely disappear once trading costs are taken into account (e.., Ball, Kothari
and Wasley, 1995; Conrad, Gultekin and Kaul, 1997; Avramov, Chordia and Goyal,
2006). Consistent with this stream of literature, we find that, indeed, the returns of a
conventional reversal strategy net of trading costs are indistinguishable from zero or even
negative. However, when we investigate the impact of trading costs on the profitability of
residual reversal strategies, we find that the profits of the strategy exceed any reasonable
level of trading costs by a wide margin, Even though reversal strategies generate high
portfolio turnover, we find that residual reversal strategies yield significantly positive
returns of more than 7% per annum net of trading costs.

The large residual reversal profits we document are remarkably robust over time and the
cross-section of stocks. We find that the residual reversal strategy outperforms a conventional
reversal strategy during every single decade in our sample in terms of risk-adjusted return,
Most notably, the residual reversal strategy earns large positive returns during the wo
most recent decades, following the public dissemination of the reversal effect, while the
conventional reversal strategy earns returns close to zero over the same period. In fact, over
the post-1990 period, the residual reversal strategy yields large positive returns after trading
costs even when we restrict the investment universe to the 500 or only 100 largest USS. stocks.
Also during the five most recent years in our sample, which include the “quant meltdown” of
August 2007 and its aftermath, we observe that the residual reversal strategy consistently
outperforms a conventional reversal strategy. Moreover, when we evaluate reversal profits
within different industries, we find that the strategy based on residuall returns outperforms the
conventional strategy within each of the 10 industries of French (2011)

Our results shed new light on several alternative explanations that have been put
forward in the academic literature to understand the reversal effect. Our finding that net
reversal profits persist over the most recent decades in our sample, during which trading
volumes dramatically increased, does not support the explanation that reversals are
induced by inventory imbalances by market makers and that reversal profits are a
‘compensation for bearing inventory risks (¢.g., Jegadeesh and Titman, 1993b). In addition,
the finding that reversal profits are observed among the 500 or even 100 largest stocks is
inconsistent with the notion that non-synchronous trading contributes to reversal profits

D. Blitz etal. { Journal of Financial Markets 16 (2013) 477-S04 49

(eg, Lo and MacKinlay, 1990; Boudoukh, Richardson and Whitelaw, 1994) since this
explanation implies that reversal profits should be concentrated among small-cap stocks.
Our results do not appear to be inconsistent, however, with the explination that some
inyestors tend to overreact to information and that stock price reversals originate from
transitory changes in demand for immediacy by these impatient traders (see, eg.,
Lehmann, 1990; Jegadeesh and Titman, 199Sa). Apart from contributing to a better
understanding of the origins of the reversal effect, our findings also have important
implications for the practical implementation of reversal strategies, indicating that in order
to generate sufficiently large returns to cover trading costs, itis of crucial importance to
control for dynamic factor exposures.

Our work is related to the research of Grundy and Martin (2001), who show that
intermediate-term momentum strategies exhibit dynamic factor exposures, and the work of
Gutierrez and Pirinsky (2007) and Blitz, Huij and Martens (2011), who find that intermediate-
term momentum strategies based on residual instead of total stock returns yield significantly
higher risk-adjusted returns. Our work is also related to the strand of literature that re-examines
market anomalies after incorporating trading costs (eg., Lesmond, Schill and Zhou, 2004;
Korajezyk and Sadka, 2004; Avramov, Chordia and Goyal, 2006; Goyal, Sadka, Sadka, and
Shivakumar, 2009) and the contemporaneous work of Hameed, Mian, and Huang (2010) and
Da, Liu and Schaumburg (2011), who show that reversal profits are higher within industries
than across industries.

‘The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section 2 we analytically show
that conventional reversal strategies exhibit dynamic exposures to common factors that
affect their risks and profitability and we develop the residual reversal strategy. In Section
3 we empirically investigate the impact of these factor exposures on the risks and profits of
both reversal strategies. In Section 4 we gauge the economic significance of reversal profits
by evaluating their profitability net of trading costs. In Section 5 we conduct several
follow-up analyses, including an examination of the comparative strength of both reversal
strategies, the profitability of both reversal strategies within industries, the relation
between reversal strategies’ dynamic factor exposures and their profitability using a non-
parametric approach, calendar month effects, and the robustness of our results to using
alternative portfolio weighting schemes. In Section 6 we discuss the implications of our
empirical findings for alternative explanations that have been put forward in the academic
literature to understand the reversal effect. Finally, we conclude in Section 7.

2. Analytical analysis

In this section we analytically show that conventional reversal strategies implicitly
exhibit dynamic exposures to common factors that affect their risks and profitability
Additionally, we develop a reversal strategy based on residual stock returns that does not
exhibit these dynamic factor exposures.

Let us assume that stock returns are described by the following K-factor model:

rig =i + BE + Bie. wo
a

where y= Sf_, Bf is the unconditional expected return of stock i; y(>0 is the
unconditionally expected return on factor k; f= r4—y is the return on factor k above its

expectation at time fis the residual return at time 1; and fi is the exposure of stock ito
factor k. Without loss of generality, we assume the K factors are orthogonal, so EUfif/]=0
for i#j and E[(/)]=a}.. In addition, we assume that Covlfif{_\]=0 for i#j and
Conf )=0 for ij

Because of its analytical tractability, we follow Lehmann (1990), Lo and MacKinlay
(1990), and Jegadeesh and Titman (199Sa) and consider a (zero-investment) conventional
reversal strategy that assigns a portfolio weight to stock fat time 1 of

where 0% =(1/N) (BiB). Hence, the right-hand side of Eq. (3) shows that the
conventional reversal strategy’s common factor exposures consist of a systematic and a
dynamic component, The first component indicates that the conventional reversal strategy,
is systematically negatively exposed to factors that have a positive expected return, while
the second component implies that the reversal strategy has dynamic factor exposures
depending on the demeaned factor returns over the formation period. For example, when
the market return is positive over the formation period, high-beta stocks typically earn
higher average returns than low-beta stocks, causing the conventional reversal strategy to
assign a relatively low weight to high-beta stocks and a high weight to low-beta stocks. As
the net market beta of the reversal strategy is negative over the subsequent
eriod.

and

)

Hence, the profits of a conventional reversal strategy can be decomposed into four
different components. The first component, 02, is the cross-sectional variance of expected
stock returns. This component has a negative impact on reversal profits, which results from
the conventional reversal strategy being systematically negatively exposed to factors with
positive expected returns. The second component, ®, is the sum of the cross-sectional
variances in factor exposures times the persistence in factor returns. This component
captures that the systematic exposures towards positive factors are exacerbated when
persistence in factor returns is stronger. The third component, 4,_, captures the short-
term dynamics in total reversal profits due to the strategy's dynamic factor exposures
conditional on the factor realizations at time 11. It is equal to the dynamic factor
exposures component, which follows from Eq. (3), times the conditionally expected factor
returns at time ¢, Since the factor exposures of a conventional reversal strategy are
inversely related to the unexpected factor returns over the past month, this component can
have either a positive or a negative impact on reversal profits, depending on the extent to
which factor returns persist. If factor returns exhibit positive autocorrelation, the impact of
this component on the total reversal profits is negative. The final component, ¥, results
from autocorrelation in the residual stocks returns and is positive if residual stock returns
exhibit negative serial correlation,

Our analytical exercise above not only demonstrates that conventional reversal
strategies exhibit factor exposures that have a negative impact on their profitability, but
can also be used to show that these exposures affect the variability in the strategy’s profits:

Eq, (9) implies that if the lagged factor returns are more extreme and the magnitude of
factor exposures is larger, the variance in expected reversal profits is also higher.

strategy that assigns a portfolio weight to stock i at time fof

while the variability for the residual reversal strategy's profits is given by

Hence, by construction the residual reversal strategy does not have systematic and
dynamic exposures to the K factors. Contrary to the conventional reversal strategy, the
residual reversal strategy’s profits are not reduced by having systematic negative exposures
to factors with positive expected returns. Moreover, the strategy’s profits do not depend on
persistence in factor returns.

Given the stylized fact that factor returns exhibit some persistence (e.g., Fisher, 1966;
Moskowitz and Grinblatt, 1999; Chen and De Bondt, 2004), we can deduce that the returns
ofa conventional reversal strategy are negatively affected by the strategy’s negative exposure
to the short-term momentum effect in factor returns and that, consequently, the expected
return is larger for our residual reversal strategy. A second notable difference with the
conventional reversal strategy is that the profits of a residual reversal strategy can be expected
to exhibit a lower variability as a result of not having factor exposures. We therefore expect a
residual reversal strategy to outperform a conventional reversal strategy in terms of both risk
and return, In the subsequent sections we empirically test this conjecture.

In this section we present our main empirical results. We first describe our data. Next we
examine the characteristics and performance of a conventional short-term reversal
strategy, after which we conduct a similar analysis for our residual reversal strategy.
Finally, we discuss the robustness of our findings over time.

3.2. Factor exposures of conventional reversal strategies

In our first empirical analysis we investigate the extent to which conventional reversal
strategies based on total stock returns exhibit dynamic exposures to the Fama and French
(1993) (henceforth, Fama-French) factors. We use these factors in our analysis since they
are widely accepted factors for explaining a large portion of the variability in U.S. stock
returns, Reversal portfolios are constructed by sorting stocks at the end of each month into
winner and loser portfolios based on their returns during that month. The winner portfolio
consists of all the stocks with returns over the past month above the cross-sectional
average and the loser portfolio consists of stocks with returns below the cross-sectional
average, with weights inversely proportional to each stock's past I-month return in excess
of the return on the equally-weighted index as in Eq. (2). We also employ alternative
portfolio weighting schemes, including equal- and value-weighting. As we discuss in detail
in Section 5.5, the outcomes are virtually identical for all these weighting schemes.

Next, we estimate the winner and loser portfolios’ exposures to the Fama-French factors
at the end of each month by taking the weighted factor exposures of all stocks in the
winner and loser portfolios. Exposures to the Fama-French factors are estimated over the
preceding 36 months [/—36, 11] from

are parameters to be estimated; and é,, is the residual return of stock i in month t.

In Fig. 1 we plot the estimated factor exposures of the winner and loser portfolios
against the returns of the Fama-French factors in month tI. Panel A shows the market
betas against the excess return on the market portfolio during the formation month
Consistent with the predictions of our analytical model in the previous section, we observe
a negative relation between the market beta of the loser portfolio and lagged market
returns, and a positive relation for the winner portfolio. Hence, a conventional reversal
strategy that is long in loser stocks and short in winner stocks exhibits dynamic exposures
to the market factor depending on the sign and magnitude of the return on the market
factor during the formation month 1

Likewise, Panels B and C of Fig. | plot the SMB and HML factor exposures of the
winner and the loser portfolios against the formation period returns on the SMB and
HML factors, respectively. We observe that the conventional reversal strategy also exhibits

results demonstrate that conventional reversal strategies
Fama-French factors.

To illustrate the impact of the dynamic exposures to the Fama-French factors on the
risks and profits of conventional reversal strategies, we evaluate reversal returns using a
conditional factor model in the spirit of Grundy and Martin (2001)
a+ BIRMRE, + (SMB, + PS HML, + f* RMRF_UP,
+B°SMB_UP, + f° HML_UP, + 64. as)
where RMRF_UP,, SMB_UP,, and HML_UP, are interaction variables that indicate the
excess returns on the RMRF, SMB, and HML factors in month t, respectively, if the
returns on the factors are positive in month 11, and zero otherwise. In this setup, finding
significantly negative coefficients for the interaction variables is consistent with the factor
exposures of reversal strategies being inversely related to the signs of the factor returns
over the past month.

‘The results of the conditional factor model analysis for the conventional reversal
strategy are presented in Panel A of Table 1. Consistent with our expectation, the
coefficient estimates for RMRF, and HML, ate significantly positive, while the estimates
for RMRF_UP, and HML_UP, are significantly negative. Only the exposures to the SMB
factor are insignificant, but this is not surprising in light of the fact that we exclude stocks
with a share price below $5 or a market capitalization below the NYSE median from our
sample, The results indicate that the dynamics of the conventional reversal strategy's factor

exhibit dynamic exposures to the

D. Blitz etal. { Journal of Financial Markets 16 (2013) 477-S04 487

exposures are statistically significant, and also that these exposures explain a significant
portion of the strategy’s risks. More specifically, the adjusted K? of 27% for our relatively
simple conditional regression model indicates that over one-fourth of the variability in the
conventional reversal strategy’s returns can be attributed to dynamic factor exposures.

Our analytical analysis in the previous section showed that persistence in factor returns
hurts the profitability of a conventional reversal strategy. As several authors report
persistence in common factor returns (¢.g., Fisher, 1966; Moskowitz and Grinblatt, 1999;
Chen and De Bondt, 2004), this concern is justified. Consistent with these studies, we
indeed observe short-term momentum in common factor returns over our sample period.
More specifically, over the January 1929 to December 2010 period, the market, size
and value factors show positive persistence in 55%, 54%, and 56% of the months,
respectively.! Hence, we expect that the dynamic factor exposures of conventional reversal
strategies negatively affect the strategies’ profits. Consistent with this notion, we find that
the alpha of the conventional reversal strategy following from the conditional model in
Eq, (15) is larger than its raw return, The conventional reversal strategy based on total
stock returns earns an average return of 69 basis points per month, while the strategy’s
alpha is 87 basis points per month. The strategy’s negative exposure to short-term
persistence in the Fama-French factors therefore appears to come at the cost of 18 basis
points per month (87-69). All in all, the results show that the conventional reversal
strategy’s dynamic factor exposures significantly contribute to the strategy’s risk and
negatively affect its profitability.

3.3. Factor exposures of reversal strategies based on residual returns

‘As an alternative to conventional reversal strategy based on total stock returns, we
propose to construct reversal portfolios based on residual stock returns resulting from
performing rolling regressions using the Fama and French (1993) model. More specifically,
wwe construct residual reversal portfolios by sorting stocks into either a winner ot a loser
portfolio at the end of each month based on their estimated residual returns during that
month, For each stock i and each formation month ‘1, we estimate Eq, (14) using stock
returns over the preceding 36 months {/—36, tI]. Next, the estimated residual returns are
standardized by dividing them by their standard deviations over the preceding 36 months.
Standardization of the residual returns yields an improved measure of the extent to which
a given firm-specific return shock is actually news, as opposed to noise, This facilitates a
better interpretation of the residual as firm-specific information (Gutierrez. and Pirinsky,
2007), Following the portfolio construction for the conventional reversal strategy, the
winner (loser) portfolio of the residual reversal strategy consists of the stocks with an
above (below) average standardized residual return

Both portfolios are designed to be orthogonal to the Fama-French factors. To
investigate the extent to which the factors are actually factor-neutral, we plot the factor
exposures of the winner and loser portfolios of the residual reversal strategy against the
factor returns during the formation month in Fig. 2. The residual reversal strategy clearly
succeeds in avoiding dynamic factor exposures. While Fig. I shows an “X”-shaped relation
between the factor exposures and lagged factor returns for the conventional reversal

‘We measure persistence bythe empirical probability of having two consceutvefactor-return observations with
the same sign
488 D. Blitz etal. | Jownal of Financial Markets 16 (2013) 477-04

strategy’s winner and loser portfolios, such a relation is not observable for the residual
reversal strategy’s winner and loser portfolios.

Panel B of Table 1 shows the conditional regression results for the residual reversal
strategy. As expected, the residual reversal strategy outperforms the conventional reversal
strategy in terms of both raw returns and risk-adjusted returns. The residual reversal
strategy on average earns 90 basis points per month, which is 21 basis points more than the
conventional reversal strategy. Moreover, the coefficient estimates of the conditional
regression model in Eq. (15) are much closer to zero compared to the coefficient estimates
for the conventional reversal strategy. At the same time, the R? value of the conditional
regression model for the residual reversal strategy is close to zero, AS a result, the alpha of
the residual reversal strategy is virtually identical to the strategy’s return. This observation
is consistent with the predictions that follow from the analytical analysis discussed in the
previous section, We also note that the alphas of the conventional and residual reversal
strategies are almost identical, at 87 and 90 basis points per month, respectively. Assuming
the conditional regression model from Eq, (15) is able to pick up the (dynamics in) factor
exposures correctly, this is again consistent with the predictions that follow from the
analytical analysis. To see this, compare Eqs. (4) and (12) and notice that the differences
between the expected profits of the two reversal strategies only arise as a result of their
differences between the factor exposures, for which we correct using the conditional
regression model. Finally, note that compared to the conventional reversal strategy, the
residual reversal strategy’s profits are also substantially less volatile. As a result, its Sharpe
ratio of 1.20 is more than twice as large as the 0.57 Sharpe ratio of the conventional
reversal strategy. Hence, ranking stocks on their residual returns is an effective approach
for neutralizing the dynamic factor exposures that are present in conventional reversal
strategies based on total returns.

Our results in the previous subsection are based on the full January 1929 to December 2010
period. We now investigate both reversal strategies’ profits over time and in different
subperiods. Fig. 3 displays the cumulative returns for a hypothetical $1 invested in each of the
two reversal strategies in January 1929, We observe that the graph corresponding to the
residual reversal strategy (black) is steeper than the graph corresponding to the conventional
reversal strategy (gray). Moreover, whereas the return on the conventional reversal strategy
appears to flatten off over the most recent 20 years of our sample, the cumulative return of the
residual reversal strategy portfolio continues to increase during the same period.

We further examine the performance of both reversal strategies over time by calculating
average returns and Sharpe ratios for each decade in our sample, As reported in Table 2,
the conventional reversal strategy earns significant profits in five of the eight decades,
Notably, the strategy is not profitable during the two most recent decades. This finding is
consistent with results of Stivers and Sun (2011), who also document that the short-term
reversal effect has substantially weakened over the post-1990 period, following the
publication of several papers that describe the effect. In contrast, the residual reversal
strategy earns significantly positive returns in each of the eight decades in our sample,
including the 1990s and 2000s. Its return over these decades of 0.74% per month (t-statistic
of 3.89) is also not much different from its long-run average return. Even when we consider
the five most recent years of our sample period from 2006 to 2010, which includes the

“quant meltdown” in 2007, the residual reversal strategy outperforms the conventional
reversal strategy in every year.

We argue that the weakening of the returns of a conventional reversal strategy can
largely be attributed to the impact of the strategy’s dynamic factor exposures. being
particularly negative over the two most recent decades of our sample. To gauge the
magnitude of this negative impact, we evaluate the performance of a reversal strategy
based on systematic returns, ie., non-residual stock returns over the full sample period and
the period from January 1990 to December 2010.° For the pre-1990 period, we find a
return of —0.05% (t-statistic of -0.43) per month, whereas for the period from 1990
onwards, we find a return of ~0.68% (t-statistic of —2.58) per month. It thus appears that
the negative return impact of a conventional reversal strategy’s dynamic factor exposures
has increased to a significant level over the two most recent decades in the sample. As the
residual component of stock returns still exhibits a large reversal effect over this period, the
weak performance of conventional reversal strategies over the past two decades is largely
attributable to the detrimental impact of the strategies’ dynamic factor exposures over this
particular period

Table 2 also shows that the residual reversal strategy outperforms the conventional
reversal strategy in all but one decade in our sample in terms of raw returns, and in each
decade in terms of risk-adjusted returns. The Jobson and Korkie (1981) test statistics show
that the difference in Sharpe ratios is statistically significant in each decade. To summarize,
our subperiod results show that the residual reversal strategy exhibits a strong performance
relative to the conventional reversal strategy in each of the eight decades in our sample
period, as well as over the long run,

4, Reversal profits and trading costs

Consistent with most of the literature, we find that reversal strategies yield large positive
returns, The results obtained hitherto, however, ignore the impact of trading costs, such as
bid-ask spreads, commissions, and price impact costs. A recent strand of literature
re-examines stock market anomalies after incorporating trading costs. For example,
Lesmond, Schill and Zhou (2004) and Korajezyk and Sadka (2004) argue that momentum
profits are difficult to capture because momentum strategies require frequent rebalancing,
while Chordia, Goyal, Sadka, Sadka, and Shivakumar, (2009) study the profitability of an
investment strategy based on the post-earnings announcement drift and find that trading
costs of the strategy are likely to be larger than the hypothetical profits. Directly related to
our study, several studies find that a large portion of the profitability of a conventional
reversal strategy disappears once trading costs are taken into account (e.g., Ball, Kothari
and Wasley, 1993; Conrad, Gultekin and Kaul, 1997; Avramov, Chordia and Goyal,
2006). In particular, Avramov, Chordia and Goyal (2006) find that stocks with the smallest
capitalization and highest illiquidity exhibit the largest reversals. These stocks are also very

expensive to trade, however. After taking trading costs into account, the authors find that
a conventional reversal strategy does not yield positive net returns.

Consistent with Avramov, Chordia and Goyall (2006) and most of the related literature,
we construct equally-weighted decile and quintile reversal portfolios of stocks and estimate
trading costs using the model of Keim and Madhavan (1997) to investigate if reversal
profits remain significant once trading costs are taken into account. Keim and Madhavan
provide estimates of trading costs for 21 institutions from 1991 to 1993. These trading cost
estimates include commissions paid, as well as an estimate of the price impact (including
the impact of crossing the bid-ask spread) of the trades. Since trading costs are likely
to be substantially larger before this period and because we have no reliable estimates
before the 1990s, we perform this part of our analysis for the period from of January
1990 to December 2010, Based on the Keim and Madhavan (1997) estimates, we

respectively, where C2” (C#") is the trading cost at time 1 in case order fis a buy-initiated
(sell-initiated) order; D*““ is a dummy variable that takes the value one for stocks traded
con the NASDAQ markets and is zero otherwise: MC,, is the market capitalization in
month 1 of the stock traded: and P,, is the price per share of the stock traded at time f.
Furthermore, we restrict the trading costs of a single order to be nonnegative.

The profits of both reversal strategies over this recent period are shown in Table 3, Panel
‘A. As discussed in the previous section, the average gross returns of both reversal strategies
are lower over this period compared to those over the full 1929-2010 sample period. In
fact, the return on the conventional reversal strategy is only 25 basis points per month
and statistically indistinguishable from zero over the post-1990 period. Not surprisingly
therefore, the net returns of the conventional reversal strategy even become negative after
estimated trading costs are taken into account. These findings are consistent with the
results reported by Avramov, Chordia and Goyal (2006). The residual reversal strategy,
however, earns an average gross return of 102 basis points per month over the same period.
Even afier trading costs are taken into account, the strategy remains highly profitable, with
a net return of 66 basis points per month. We estimate that the break-even level is reached
for trading costs of 56 basis points for a round-trip transaction. With such a high break-
even level, it seems very unlikely that trading costs prevent profitable execution of a
residual reversal strategy. Examining the distribution of trading costs for the cross-section
of stocks over time, we find that the 80th percentile corresponds to roughly 60 basis points
per round-trip transaction, In other words, trading costs would only subsume the profits of
the residual reversal strategy if the strategy would systematically trade in the 20% most
illiquid stocks in our sample. The results also show that the net returns, in excess of the
CRSP total return index, of the individual long (Losers) and short (Winners) portfolios of
the residual reversal strategy are both significantly positive and roughly equally large. This
finding indicates that the residual reversal profits are not concentrated in short positions.

We further evaluate the profitability of reversal strategies by excluding small
capitalization stocks from our sample. Panels B and C of Table 3 show the results for,
ively, the largest 500 and largest 100 stocks in our sample.’ For both subsample
the net profits of the conventional reversal strategy are not significantly larger than zero.
In contrast, with net returns of 60 and 73 basis points per month, the residual reversal
strategy generates statistically and economically significant profits for both subsamples.
The estimated break-even levels of trading costs are 46 and 47 basis points per round-trip
transaction.

Besides taking into account trading costs, we also want to incorporate the effect of a
potential implementation lag that might occur with a real-time application of a reversal
strategy. To this end we additionally compute stock returns using return data from the
daily CRSP US Stock Database, skipping the first trading day of each month.* The returns
of the reversal strategies with a I-day skip are presented in the third column of Table 3.
Even afier taking trading costs and an implementation lag into account, we find that the
residual reversal strategies for the 500 and 100 largest stocks in our sample generate large
net profits of 44 and 54 basis points per month, respectively. Therefore, it is very unlikely
that reallife frictions such as trading costs and implementation lags prevent the profitable
execution of residual reversal strategies.

Our approach to examine the economic significance of reversal profits is likely
conservative. First, as Keim and Madhavan (1997) show in their study, trading style may
have a significant impact on trading costs. For example, technical traders that follow
momentumlike strategies and have a great demand for immediacy typically experience
large bid-ask costs, since the market demand for the stocks they aim to buy is substantially
larger than the supply, and vice versa for sell transactions. In their study, Keim and
Madhavan (1997) also find that technical traders generally experience higher trading costs
than traders following strategies that demand less immediacy, such as value traders or
index managers, and adjust trading cost estimates for these styles. Lehmann (1990) argues
that short-term reversal traders are liquidity providers, and likely benefit from buying
(shorting) prior period losers (winners) near the bid (ask). The Keim and Madhavan (1997)
model, however, does not make an adjustment for liquidity-providing trading styles, such
as reversal strategies. Because reversal strategies provide liquidity, trading costs are likely
to be somewhat lower than the estimates we use in this analysis.

Second, in this study we investigate naive top-minus-bottom decile reversal strategies that
are rebalanced at a monthly frequency, In a recent study, De Groot, Huij and Zhou (2012)
show that applying a more sophisticated portfolio construction algorithm can help to
significantly reduce the turnover of reversal strategies without lowering their expected returns
In their application, the authors find that more sophisticated buy/sell rules can approximately
halve the negative impact of trading costs on reversal profits. By not taking into account the
liquidity-providing nature of reversal trading, and by ignoring the potential efficiency gains
that may be obtained with more sophisticated portfolio construction rules, our results are
likely to underestimate the full profit potential of residual reversal investment strategies

“In order to have a suiient large number of stocks in the portfolios, we sort stocks into quintiles instead of
deciles when we evaluate the profitability of reversal strategies forthe largest 00 and 100 stocks,

A final observation is that the higher net return of the residual reversal strategy
compared to the conventional reversal strategy comes from its higher gross expected
return, as well as from incurring lower trading costs. For example, while the gross return
difference between the conventional and residual reversal strategies is 77 basis points per
month (102-25 basis points; see Table 3), the difference in net returns is 90 basis points per
month (66+24 basis points). The reason for the lower trading costs of the residual reversal
strategy is that, unlike the conventional reversal strategy, it does not trade excessively in
volatile, small stocks. When stocks are ranked on raw past returns, stocks with the highest
volatility have the greatest probability to end up in the extreme quantiles. These stocks are
typically the stocks with the smallest market capitalizations. As a result, a portfolio that is
Jong and short in these extreme quantiles is typically biased towards the smaller
capitalization stocks. However, these stocks are also the most expensive to trade, so this
feature of the conventional reversal strategy is harmful to its after-cost profitability,
Because the residual reversal strategy is constructed in such a way that itis neutral to the
SMB factor, we expect this effect to be less pronounced for the residual reversal strategy,

To investigate whether this conjecture is true, we consider the decile portfolios’
characteristics for both reversal strategies in Table 4,

Consistent with the intuition that stocks with the highest volatility have the greatest
probability to end up in the extreme quantiles when stocks are ranked on raw past returns,
Table 4 shows that the top and bottom deciles for a conventional reversal strategy exhibit a
substantially higher volatility than the mid-ranked portfolios. Furthermore, the portfolios’
exposures to the SMB factor are substantially larger and their ranks on market
capitalization are lower. When we consider the characteristics of the top and bottom decile
portfolios for the residual reversal strategy, we do not observe that the extreme deciles
contain more volatile, small-cap stocks. As a consequence, the trading costs involved with
the residual reversal strategy are significantly lower than the costs associated with the
conventional reversal strategy. For example, the single-trip buy trading costs for loser
stocks based on the conventional reversal strategy are 28 basis points, vs. 18 basis points
for the residual reversal strategy. Similarly, the single-trip sell costs for loser stocks based
on the conventional reversal strategy are 4 basis points, compared to only 2 basis points for
the residual reversal strategy.

5. Follow-up empirical analyses

In this section we conduct several follow-up analyses. We first examine the comparative
strength of both reversal strategies. Next, we investigate the profitability of both reversal
strategies within industries. We then examine the relation between reversal strategies’
dynamie factor exposures and their profitability using a non-parametric approach. This
is followed by an analysis of calendar month effects. Finally, we examine the robustness of
our results to using alternative portfolio weighting schemes,

Sil. Cross-sectional Fama-MacBeth regressions and double-sorted rank portfolios

We perform cross-sectional regressions in the spirit of Fama and MacBeth (1973) to
investigate what portion of the predictive power of total stock returns can be attributed to
the residual component of the return, These regressions are performed at the individual
stock level, allowing us to control for other effects. More specifically, we estimate the

‘ores of the lagged total returns (2), indicating that past month stock returns have
predictive power for future stock returns. However, once =-scores of lagged residual
returns (<') are included, all predictive power disappears. In the second regression
specification, in which a distinction is made between (residual) return loser stocks and
winner stocks, there is an asymmetric total return reversal effect. The residual return
reversal effect. on the other hand, is equally strong for loser stocks as for winner stocks.
Including all four interaction variables results in significant reversal effects for residual
return losers and winners, but no reversal effect for total return winners, This finding is in
line with the results of Jegadeesh and Titman (1995a), who report that over- or under-
reaction to firm-specific information always contributes to the profitability of reversal
strategies, while over- or under-reaction to the systematic factors can either reduce or
increase these profits.

‘We now construct double-sorted rank portfolios to further investigate what portion of
the predictive power of stocks’ total returns can be attributed to the residual component of
the return. For brevity, we do not report the results of this analysis in tabular form. To
construct double-sorted rank portfolios, we start by sorting stocks into quintile portfolios
based on their total returns and then subdivide each total-return quintile into quintiles
based on the stocks’ residual returns. This process generates 25 portfolios that all contain
an equal number of stocks. When we consider the portfolios’ average returns over the
investment month, we observe that the returns are monotonically decreasing over the
residual return quintiles within each total return quintile. The residual return loser quintil
outperforms the residual return winner quintile by at least 62 basis points per month.
Controlling for total returns, the loser-minus-winner spread is highly significant at 78 basis
points per month. These results indicate that residual stock returns have predictive power
for future stock returns above and beyond that of total stock returns,

Next, we perform a similar double-sorting procedure, but now first sorting stocks into
quintiles based on their residual returns and then subdividing the stocks into quintiles
based on their total returns. Interestingly, when we consider these portfolios’ reversal-
weighted returns over the investment month, we do not observe any return pattern at all
across the portfolios sorted on total stock returns; the return spread between losers and
winners is close to zero in all cases. Hence, after controlling for residual returns, total
returns do not appear to have predictive power for future stock returns. These results
corroborate our previous finding that most of the predictive power of total stock returns
can be attributed to the residual component of the return:

5.2. Within-industry reversal profits

In this section we explore the profitability of both reversal strategies within different
industries. Our motivation to investigate this issue stems from the contemporaneous
findings of Hameed, Mian, and Huang (2010) and Da, Liu and Schaumburg (2011),
who report higher returns for within-industry reversal strategies. To investigate if the
residualization of stock returns relative to the Fama-French factors goes above and
beyond correcting for industry effects, we compare conventional and residual reversal
strategies applied within each of the 10 industries of French (2011). Similar to our earlier

within-industry reversal strategy. The average return increases from 0.90% to 1.12% per
month and the Sharpe ratio doubles, from 0.99 to 1.98. In fact, the residualization
approach improves the Sharpe ratio within each of the 10 different industries. In Panel B
of Table 6 we examine the results over the post-1990 period. Comparing these results to
those in Table 2, applying a conventional reversal strategy within industries does little to
improve its weak performance over this period, with average returns increasing only
marginally from 0.22% to 0.38% per month. The residual reversal strategy, on the other
hand, continues to perform strongly over the same period, regardless of whether the
strategy is applied within industries or not. The within-industry application raw returns are
slightly higher (0.78% per month vs. 0.74% per month) and the risk-adjusted returns are
much higher (Sharpe ratio of 1.35 vs, 0.85) too.

These results imply that residualization offers distinct benefits that cannot be simply
captured by neutralizing industry exposures and that, rather than being substitutes, the
two approaches are complimentary. To put it differently, a reversal strategy is in general
most effective when both dynamic exposures to the Fama-French factors and dynamic
exposures to industries are neutralized. This is consistent with the finding of several
authors that the Fama and French factors do not suffice to describe the returns on industry
portfolios (see, e.g., Fama and French, 1997).

5.3. Non-parametric approach to measuring factor exposures

Most of our evidence reported so far on the impact of dynamic factor exposures on the
profitability of reversal strategies relies on the outcomes of the conditional factor
regressions in the spirit of Grundy and Martin (2001) we performed in the previous section.
In this section we re-investigate the relation between reversal strategies’ dynamic factor
exposures and their profitability using a non-parametric approach that, unlike the factor
regressions, does not rely on a linear factor structure, More specifically, with our non-
parametric approach we regress the returns of the reversal strategies on dummy variables
that indicate the number of Fama-French factors that revert (i., for which the sign of the

return during the formation period and investment period are different). If reversal
strategies exhibit dynamic factor exposures that are inversely related to the signs of the
factor returns during the formation period, reversal profits are negatively affected by
persistence in common factor returns and returns are lower when fewer factors revert

The results in Table 7 indicate that a conventional reversal strategy exhibits dynamic
factor exposures that affect its profitability: reversal profits appear to increase
monotonically with the number of Fama-French factors that revert. When all Fama-
French factors persist, the strategy earns a negative return of ~61 basis points per month.
In contrast, when all Fama-French factors revert, the conventional reversal strategy earns
a highly positive return of 3.57% per month, Interestingly, the residual reversal strategy
does not seem to exhibit such dynamic factor exposures as the strategy earns positive
returns irrespective of the number of factors that revert, ranging between 0.70% and
1.51% per month, In all cases, the residual reversal profits are highly significant. These
results are consistent with our previous finding that a residual reversal strategy is less
sensitive to the returns of common factors over the investment period than a conventional
reversal strategy, resulting in less volatile returns.

54. Calendar month effects

Proceeding further, we investigate the performances of the conventional and residual
reversal strategies per calendar month. Several authors document strong seasonal patterns
in reversal returns (e.g., Grinblatt and Moskowitz, 2004). In particular, average reversal
returns in January are found to be highly positive. The cited reason is the tax-loss selling
effect: fund managers tend to sell small-cap loser stocks by the year-end, resulting in
downward price pressure in that month, which is followed by an upward price pressure in
January. Because a reversal strategy is long in small-cap loser stocks, this effect causes a
large positive return for the strategy in January. We refer to Roll (1983), Griffiths and
White (1993), and D’Mello, Ferris, and Hwang (2003) for a detailed discussion of this
effect.

Because a residual reversal strategy is less concentrated in small-cap stocks compared to
conventional reversal strategy, we expect the January effect to have a smaller impact
on the performance of a residual reversal strategy. Therefore, we examine the average
monthly returns during each calendar month for the conventional reversal vs. the residual
reversal strategy. The results are presented in Table 8,

Consistent with the prior literature, Table 8 shows that a large portion of the reversal
profits are concentrated in January months. For example, the statistics of the
conventional reversal strategy’s returns exceed +2.0 in only 4 out of 12 months. By
contrast, residual reversal returns have t-statistics larger than +2.0 in 10 out of 12 months.
Interestingly, for the post-1990 period, the conventional reversal strategy only earns
positive returns in January. The average returns on other months are an insignificant
0.05%. The residual reversal strategy, on the other hand, earns positive returns in January,
as well as large positive returns of 0.63% on average in other months. Thus, residual
reversal strategies are also more robust than conventional reversal strategies during the
calendar year

5.5, Alternative weighting schemes

We performed most of our analyses on return-weighted portfolios as there does not seem
to be a consensus in the literature on the use of a particular weighting scheme. Several
important studies on the reversal effect employ a return-weighting scheme to construct
reversal portfolios (¢.g., Lehmann, 1990; Lo and MacKinlay, 1990; Jegadeesh and Titman,
1995a; Da, Liu and Schaumburg, 2011). However, there are also studies that employ
equally-weighted portfolios instead (e.g., Jegadeesh, 1990; Boudoukh, Richardson and
Whitelaw, 1994; Avramov, Chordia and Goyal, 2006; Hameed, Mian, and Huang, 2010;
Stivers and Sun, 2011; De Groot, Huij and Zhou, 2012), while the short-term reversal
factor of French (2011) is constructed using a value-weighting scheme. To investigate the
robustness of our findings to the use of alternative weighting schemes, we redo all our
analyses using equal-weighted and value-weighted decile portfolios. For brevity, the results
of these analyses are not reported in tabular form but are available upon request from the
authors. While the results of the analyses using the alternative weighting schemes are
qualitatively very similar, they are generally the strongest for the equally-weighting
scheme (e.g., the returns of the conventional and residual reversal strategies are 0.92% and
1.28% per month, respectively, vs. 0.69% and 0.87% per month for the return-weighting
scheme; see Table 1), and somewhat less pronounced using the value-weighting

02 D. Blitz etal. | Jownal of Financial Markets 16 (2013) 477-04

scheme (e.g., the returns of the conventional and residual reversal strategies are 0.53% and
0.74% per month, respectively). For both alternative weighting schemes, the residual
reversal strategy is more than 30% less volatile compared to the conventional reversal
strategy. The profits of the residual reversal strategy for both alternative weighting
schemes remain statistically and economically large over the most recent decades in our
sample, We conclude that our results are robust to the weighting scheme used to construct
reversal portfolios.

6. Explanations for short-term stock reversals,

In this section we discuss alternative hypotheses that have been put forward in the
academic literature for understanding the reversal anomaly and the extent to which our
results are consistent with the predictions following from these explanations. The literature
on short-term stock reversals provides three main explanations for the effect: (1) reversals
are the result of liquidity effects (e.g., Jegadeesh and Titman, 1995b); (2) reversals originate
from non-synchronous trading of small and large cap stocks (e.g., Lo and MacKinlay,
1990; Boudoukh, Richardson and Whitelaw, 1994); and (3) reversals are the result of
investor overreaction to new information in the market (e.g., Lehmann, 1990; Jegad
and Titman, 1995a).

Our finding that net reversal profits persist over the most recent decades in our sample,
during which market liquidity dramatically increased, is not supportive of the explanation
that reversals are induced by inventory imbalances by market makers and that reversal
profits are a compensation for bearing inventory risks. Also, our finding that reversal
profits are observed among the 500 and even 100 largest stocks is inconsistent with the
notion that non-synchronous trading contributes to reversal profits. Only the behavioral
explanation that investors tend to overreact to information and that stock price reversals
originate from transitory changes in demand for immediacy by these impatient traders,
does not appear to be inconsistent with our findings, Our finding that the short-term
reversal effect is concentrated in the firm-specific component of stock returns is consistent
with the results of Gutierrez and Pirinsky (2007), who argue that agency issues in the
money management industry (ie, institutions keeping their portfolios near a market index
for reputation and career concerns) cause mispricing to be larger in the idiosyncratic return
component of momentum strategies.

However, our results do not provide direct evidence in support of such a (rationalized)
behavioral explanation. A formal test for competing explanations for the short-term
reversal effect is beyond the scope of this paper. An interesting avenue for future research
would involve an in-depth empirical investigation of the relation between reversal profits
and proxies for liquidity provision and investor sentiment [e.g., the sentiment factor
of Baker and Wurgler (2006)] to directly test the liquidity hypothesis vs. the overreaction
hypothesis. Another interesting research question that emerges from our results is,
if reversals indeed originate from investor overreaction, why investors overreact to
firm-specific information and not to macro information, A framework as employed by
Gutierrez and Pirinsky (2007) that incorporates institutional holdings data might be used
to investigate this research question.

7. Conclusion

Conventional short-term reversal strategies exhibit dynamic exposures to the Fama and
French (1993) factors. These factor exposures are inversely related to factor returns over
the formation month, causing the reversal strategy to be negatively exposed to the short-
term momentum effect in factor returns. As a result, dynamic factor exposures increase the
risk of a reversal strategy, as well as negatively affect its profitability.

We show that a short-term reversal strategy based on residual stock returns does not
exhibit these dynamic factor exposures and earns returns that are substantially larger than
those of a conventional short-term reversal strategy. Additionally, the residual reversal
strategy has a significantly lower volatility. The lower volatility together with the higher
returns cause the residual reversal strategy to earn risk-adjusted returns that are twice as
large as those of a conventional reversal strategy. In faet, the profits of the residual reversal
strategy are statistically and economically significant after trading costs. The large residual
reversal profits we document are remarkably robust over time and the cross-section of
stocks.

Our results shed new light on different explanations for the reversal anomaly that have
been suggested in the literature. Our finding that net reversal profits persist over the most
recent decades in our sample, during which market liquidity dramatically increased, is not
supportive of the explanation that reversals are induced by inventory imbalances by
market makers and that reversal profits are a compensation for bearing inventory risks.
Moreover, our finding that reversal profits are observed among the 500 and even 100
largest stocks is inconsistent with the notion that non-synchronous trading contributes to
reversal profits. Our findings do not appear to be inconsistent though with the behavioral
argument that investors tend to overreact to information and that stock price reversals
originate from transitory changes in demand for immediacy by these impatient traders
(Lehmann, 1990; Jegadeesh and Titman, 1995a), although our study does not provide
direct support for this hypothesis.

Finally, our findings indicate that in order to generate returns sufficiently large enough,
to cover trading costs, itis of crucial importance to control factor exposures. Hence, apart
from contributing to a better understanding of the origins of the reversal effect, our
findings also have important implications for the practical implementation of reversal
strategies.
